FuXi's Documentation
====================

FuXi is a Python-based, bi-directional logical reasoning system for the semantic web.  FuXi aims to be the engine for contemporary expert 
systems based on the Semantic Web technologies.  It is named after the `first <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fu_Hsi>`_ of the Three Sovereigns of ancient China.  It originally formed from 
an idea to express the underlying symbols (and their relationships) in the Yi Jing or Zhou Yi ("The Book of Changes") in 
OWL and RDF in order to reason over their structural relationships.

For an overview of the architecture, please read `FuXi Overview <http://code.google.com/p/fuxi/wiki/Overview>`_ and 
`FuXi User Manual <http://code.google.com/p/fuxi/wiki/FuXiUserManual>`_ for more information.

FuXi.Rete
=========

An implementation of most of the RETE-UL algorithms outlined in the PhD thesis (1995) of Robert Doorenbos: *Production Matching for Large Learning Systems*.  See
`FuXi.Rete <http://code.google.com/p/fuxi/wiki/FuXiUserManual#FuXi_.Rete>`_ in manual for how to use SetupRuleStore to create an ReteNetwork.

FuXi.Horn
=========

Originally implemented as a reference implementation of the W3C's Rule Interchange Format Basic Logic Dialect but eventually evolved into a 
Pythonic API for managing an abstract Logic Programming syntax. Used for creating rulesets converted from OWL RDF expressions and creating 
a Horn ruleset from a parsed Notation 3 graph.

FuXi.Rete.Magic
===============

This module is where the `Sideways Information Passing <http://code.google.com/p/fuxi/wiki/Overview#Sideways_Information_Passing>`_ 
reasoning capabilities are implemented. 

.. autofunction:: FuXi.Rete.Magic.MagicSetTransformation

FuXi.SPARQL
===========

Backward chaining algorithms for SPARQL RIF-Core and OWL 2 RL entailment. The Backwards Fixpoint Procedure (BFP) implementation uses 
RETE-UL as the RIF PRD implementation of a meta-interpreter of a ruleset that evaluates conjunctive (BGPs) SPARQL queries using a 
SPARQL 1.1 RIF Entailment Regime. 

See: `Overview <http://code.google.com/p/fuxi/wiki/Overview#Backward_Chaining_/_Top_Down_Evaluation>`_ and 
`User Manual <http://code.google.com/p/fuxi/wiki/FuXiUserManual#FuXi_.SPARQL>`_

FuXi.Syntax
===========

Includes the InfixOwl library (see the linked Wiki for more information).  A Python binding for OWL Abstract Syntax that incorporates the 
Manchester OWL Syntax.  See the `Wiki <http://code.google.com/p/fuxi/wiki/InfixOwl>`_ and `OWLED paper <http://python-dlp.googlecode.com/files/infixOwl.pdf>`_
