FuXi is a Python-based, bi-directional logical reasoning system for the semantic web.

FuXi aims to be the engine for contemporary expert systems based on the Semantic Web technologies.
It is named after the [first](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fu_Hsi) of the Three Sovereigns of ancient China.

It originally formed from an idea to express the underlying symbols (and their relationships) in the Yi Jing or Zhou Yi ("The Book of Changes") in OWL and RDF in order to reason over their structural relationships.

For an overview of the architecture, please read [FuXi Overview](https://github.com/RDFLib/FuXi/blob/master/docs/Overview.rst) and [FuXi User Manual](https://github.com/RDFLib/FuXi/blob/master/docs/FuXiUserManual.rst) for more information.
